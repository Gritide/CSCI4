              <h2> Citywide 3 to 8 graders math results between 2013-2019. See whether students in New York City have improved math and able to find whether there is a problem in education system.</h2>
              <h1 className="collor">Why I picked this</h1>
              <h2>This project has personal significance to me because I was also one of the students who had to take math exams. When I took the math exams, I felt unprepared, I know others in this situation who had to retake it due to schools not preparing us for it. I wanted to compare the math exam scores throughout the years to see if there has been an improvement or not. And these are for students who is going to take this exam and creating less stressful data for them. I donâ€™t think there is an existing solution for it. Students often do not look at the data and find out success rates over the year. I just want to make the data easier to navigate and help them to understand better.</h2>

                <h2>Over the years, students have improved in math exams, this shows that the education system is improving in NYC. The main reason for this improvement is that most families have access to technology.
                   Most students have their own phones or computers. Every year there has been an improvement in students doing well in math exams. 
                   Besides the 8th graders, all other grades are above 20% high success rate (level 4), this is a good sign (If 100 students took the exam 20 of them did excellent).
                    For the 8th graders it might help to decrease the pressure/difficulty of the math exam because all 8th graders are busy with their high school application. 
                    Overall, math grades are improving over the years due to technology.
