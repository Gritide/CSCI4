When I took the math exams, I felt unprepared, I know others in this situation who had to retake it due to schools not preparing us for it. I wanted to compare the math exam scores throughout the years to see if there has been an improvement or not. And these are for students who is going to take this exam and creating less stressful data for them. I donâ€™t think there is an existing solution for it. Students often do not look at the data and find out success rates over the year. I just want to make the data easier to navigate and help them to understand better.</h1>\n              <img src= {photo} />\n  \n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
