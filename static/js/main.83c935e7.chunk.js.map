When I took the math exams, I felt unprepared, I know others in this situation who had to retake it due to schools not preparing us for it. I wanted to compare the math exam scores throughout the years to see if there has been an improvement or not. And these are for students who is going to take this exam and creating less stressful data for them. I donâ€™t think there is an existing solution for it. Students often do not look at the data and find out success rates over the year.
