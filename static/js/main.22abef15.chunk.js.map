When I took the math exams, I felt unprepared, I know others in this situation who had to retake it due to schools not preparing us for it. I wanted to compare the math exam scores throughout the years to see if there has been an improvement or not. And these are for students who is going to take this exam and creating less stressful data for them. I donâ€™t think there is an existing solution for it. Students often do not look at the data and find out success rates over the year. I just want to make the data easier to navigate and help them to understand better.</h2>\n              <div>\n              <h1 className=\"collor\">Students' math results over the years</h1>\n              <img src= {all_grades} />\n\n              <h1 className=\"collor\">Students' math exam results over the years for each grade:</h1>\n              <img src= {grade3} />\n              <img src= {grade4} />\n              <img src= {grade5} />\n              <img src= {grade6} />\n              <img src= {grade7} />\n              <img src= {grade8} />\n\n              <h1 className=\"collor\">Students' who did well in math exam over the years for each grade:</h1>\n              <img src= {for_grades3} />\n              <img src= {for_grades4} />\n              <img src= {for_grades5} />\n              <img src= {for_grades6} />\n              <img src= {for_grades7} />\n              <img src= {for_grades8} />\n             \n\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <h1 className = \"collor\"> Conclusion:</h1>\n                <h2>Over the years, students have improved in math exams, this shows that the education system is improving in NYC. The main reason for this improvement is that most families have access to technology.\n                   Most students have their own phones or computers. Every year there has been an improvement in students doing well in math exams. \n                   Besides the 8th graders, all other grades are above 20% high success rate (level 4), this is a good sign (If 100 students took the exam 20 of them did excellent).\n                    For the 8th graders it might help to decrease the pressure/difficulty of the math exam because all 8th graders are busy with their high school application. \n                    Overall, math grades are improving over the years due to technology.\n                </h2>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <h1 className=\"collor\"> Resources:</h1>\n                <h2>https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/test-results Citywide</h2>\n                <h2>https://www.readandspell.com/us/struggling-with-math</h2>\n                <h2>https://www.theedadvocate.org/10-reasons-the-u-s-education-system-is-failing/</h2>\n              </div>\n             \n              \n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
